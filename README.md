# Fv_antibody_design
Antibody design to block cell-cell transmission of Î±-synuclein 
1. LRT: Large scale Flexible docking refinement: Uses Elastic network model, Molecular dynamics with excited normal modes and pyrosetta for dealing with CDRs.
2. apo_md: Analysis on apo states of the antibody.
3. cdr_properties: Analyze CDR regions from OAS.
4. Docking: Scripts on docking.
